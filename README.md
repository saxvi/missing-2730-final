Final Project Milestone #1
Sadie Mothershed & Haven Lambert

Overview:
For our final project, we aim to create an interactive experience where the player will slowly unravel the mystery of a friend-gone-missing. They will interact with elements within a few different rooms (apartment living room, bedroom, etc.) to find out what happened to their friend and where they went. Through this exploration, the player will eventually realize that things might not be quite what they seem…

Inspiration:
Horror movies (genre)
Ideally, we want the experience to start out unassuming and then become more sinister as the player progresses. Similar to how many horror movies relay their narrative.
Example games:
The Long Dark (interaction-wise)
Suite 776 (vibe-wise; mysterious apartment similar to what we are going for)
Gone Home (kind of a mixture of the vibe of 776 and the interaction of TLD)

Interactivity:
We will use WASD & point-and-click exploration with visual novel elements. The player  character can move within a single scene using WASD and mouse, but must click on transition points (doors, other scenes, etc.) to move between them.

Narrative:
We want to instill feelings of unease and have the player leave our interactive experience with more questions than answers. Through use of game objects (notebook on desk, sticky note on fridge, receipts, etc.) we will relay instructions and bits of information about the story. The closest game object to the player upon start (notebook) will list game background and then instructions. This notebook will also potentially have a colorful outline around it just to make sure the player sees it, but other interactables throughout the experience will not have this same outline. The main goal of the player is simply to play through the entire experience by finding all the clues. 
Plot: The player is a friend or family member to Person B (name pending), who has effectively gone missing - they have not shown up to work, answered calls or texts, or been seen by the neighbors in a while. The player is trying to find out what happened to Person B by going through their apartment and looking for clues. They don’t know much, except the neighbors report that Person B had been acting a little strange lately. The clues in the apartment point to Person B having some sort of psychological breakdown, and the player becomes increasingly concerned and desperate to find their friend. Eventually the player will follow clues to a second location where Person B ended up. While there, the player will stumble upon some paranormal stuff with an implied cyclical ending.

Interactive Elements:
First person point-of-view
Keyboard and mouse with point-and-click to navigate between scenes
Locomotion will consist of teleportation and walking
Walking achieved with WASD keys
Teleportation achieved by clicking teleportation points (doors, for example)
Various objects will be interactable
The player character will pick up the object to get a closer look, bringing up a dialogue box with information associated with the object (similar to the more recent Resident Evil games)

What We Have:
We have both of our Blender comics successfully imported into Unity.
Includes all sub-assets that were used to create the original comic scenes.
We have the first-person POV plugins installed in Unity.
We have playlists of potential music (Haven), although we have not checked if they are free-to-use yet.
We have access to audio files to create a more interactive experience.
Already have footsteps added into the first person POV plugin.
We have access to basic audio software (Audacity).

What We Need:
Blender components: we will need to make more environmental items to fill in the now-3D space.
Unity components: we will likely be utilizing some of the plugins introduced to us in class, especially for making some of the environments.
Custom scripts: not sure exactly what we will need here yet, but we will figure it out as we go along.
Audio: we will need to find more sound effects to add in when the player interacts with objects. We will also need some city-like sounds to make the experience more immersive for the player as they explore the environment. Additionally, if we want to have music constantly playing in the background, we will need to find that as well.
Control methods: we will need to find a way to make the intractable elements. We already have locomotion figured out, but we need a way to make the character pick up objects and look at them.
